orderReceived -> removeInventory -> shipOrder -> confirmOrder

1) CreatePendingOrder 
	a) persist state
		(crash-check) nothing, come back online and process everything
	a) just create the order, outbox message, inbox record, in a transaction. 
		(crash-check) if we crash after, we come back online, check the inbox record, and all good
	b) transition to removeInventory

Outbox polling, sends message to Inventory Service

2) RemoveInventory
	3) Waiting for response
			(crash-check) if we crash before persisting state, we are in CreatePendingOrder. This will check the inbox, and transition directly back here
		a) Persist state
			(crash-check) come back online, still waiting for message. No problem
		b) External message handler gets message, persists inbox message
			(crash-check) this is fine, we come back up, get the message, check the inbox, do nothing besides ack message
		c) acks message, then transitions into proper state
			(crash-check) before persisting new state. This is ok, we come back online in the previous state, check inbox, and transition into this state
		c) persist new state




The KEY is that for each state that receives a message, we should check the inbox at the start to make sure we have not processed this message before. 
If we have, then we simply just move to the next state based on the message?
